mktest 1.0
	simple tool for a fast test of an algorithm or to remember
	how to use a specific function of c/c++ while you are
	working in another project and you don't want to waste

	and remembering what flags you have to use for compiler
	successfully

USAGE:
    mktest
    mktest --help		  -> show this help
    mktest --new 		  -> generate new source file
    mktest --saveCode path	  -> save the writed code on a
    				     new file in the specified

				     code file in your home
				     directory.
    mktest --template xlib 	  -> generate new source file with
		      sdl2_image     code template
		      imlib2
	 	      curl
    mktest --args     foo foo*    -> args to pass to the programs

	       clang
    debug                   	   -> enable the debugger tool
